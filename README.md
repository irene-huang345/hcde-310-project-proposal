"Getting Cozy!" is a website application that gives users movie recommendations based on live-time weather of their city.
Users are directed to a home page where they are able to see movie recommendations when the weather is sunny. If the user
would like to see more of a personalized recommendation based off of the weather in their location, they can choose 
their city from the dropdown menu and get movie recommendations. An important note: this website application only supports
major cities. If your city is on the list, we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience and we hope that you will look
forward to our next update!
